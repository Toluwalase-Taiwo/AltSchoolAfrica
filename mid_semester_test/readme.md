### Mid-Semester Break Assignment: Energy Data Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook submission is for the Mid-Semester Break Assignment of the Python Programming Language IV course at AltSchool of Data Science.

### Objective
The objective of this assignment is to analyze energy data from various sources, including the United Nations, World Bank, and Scimago Journal and Country Rank.

### Tasks
1. Load energy data from Energy Indicators.xls and perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Load GDP data from world_bank.csv and perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
3. Load Scimago Journal and Country Rank data for Energy Engineering and Power Technology from scimagojr-3.xlsx.
4. Join the three datasets into a new dataset using the intersection of country names.
5. Filter the data to include only the top 15 countries by Scimagojr 'Rank' and the last 10 years of GDP data.

### **Energy Data Analysis and Visualization Project**

#### **Objective**  
The objective of this project was to analyze **energy data** from various global sources (United Nations, World Bank, and Scimago Journal) to identify the relationship between **energy consumption**, **economic growth** (GDP), and **global research output** in the **energy engineering** sector. This type of analysis is critical in the oil and gas industry, where the demand for energy is closely linked to economic development and technological innovation.

#### **Project Tasks and Methodology**

- **Data Collection & Cleaning:**
   - Loaded **energy data** from `Energy Indicators.xls` and performed **data cleaning** and **preprocessing** to handle missing values and normalize the dataset for analysis.
   - Cleaned **GDP data** from `world_bank.csv` to ensure accurate, consistent economic indicators, especially focusing on the last **10 years** of data for recent economic trends.
   - Processed **Scimago Journal and Country Rank data** from `scimagojr-3.xlsx`, focusing on **Energy Engineering** and **Power Technology** sectors, aligning it with energy data and economic data.

- **Data Integration:**
   - Merged the three datasets into a **single unified dataset**, using **country names** as the common key for joining the data. This integration allowed for a holistic view of the relationship between **energy consumption**, **economic performance**, and **energy research output**.

- **Data Filtering & Analysis:**
   - Filtered the data to focus on the **top 15 countries** by Scimago’s **energy research rank**, providing a global perspective on the leading nations in **energy engineering**.
   - Focused the GDP analysis on the **last 10 years**, ensuring the data reflected **current economic performance** in relation to **energy sector development**.

---

#### **Key Insights & Deliverables**

- **Data Visualization:**  
   - Created visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to present key trends, such as the correlation between **energy consumption** and **GDP growth** over time, and the global distribution of **energy research output**.
   - Produced scatter plots and line charts to visualize country rankings in both **energy research output** and **GDP**, making it easy to identify the most prominent countries in both fields.

- **Findings:**  
   - Identified countries that exhibit high **energy consumption** but low **energy research output**, potentially highlighting opportunities for **innovation** and **investment** in the oil and gas sector.
   - Analyzed the relationship between **economic growth** and **energy consumption**, providing insight into how economic growth impacts the demand for energy and vice versa.

#### **Tools & Technologies Used:**

- **Python Libraries:**  
   - **Pandas** for data cleaning, preprocessing, and merging datasets
   - **Numpy** for numerical operations and handling large datasets
   - **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization

- **Documentation & Reporting:**  
   - Followed **PEP8** coding standards for clean, readable code
   - Utilized **Jupyter Notebook** for proper documentation, including Markdown to explain the code and provide **insightful conclusions** from the analysis.

---

#### **Relevance to Oil & Gas:**

- **Energy Consumption & Economic Growth:** Understanding how **energy demand** correlates with **economic growth** is crucial in the oil and gas industry for planning **energy production** and **distribution** strategies. The insights from this project could help in forecasting energy needs based on economic data.
  
- **Energy Research & Innovation:** The project’s focus on **research output** in the **energy sector** highlights the importance of technological innovation, which is key in the oil and gas sector for driving **sustainable practices** and improving **efficiency** in **energy production**.

---

### **Project Takeaways:**
This project demonstrates strong abilities in **data collection**, **data cleaning**, **data integration**, and **data visualization**, all of which are essential skills in the oil and gas industry. By analyzing energy-related data and combining it with economic insights, the project provides a comprehensive approach to understanding global energy dynamics, making it highly relevant to the oil and gas sector.
